      <p>
        Activity Tracker is a way to journal your most important events.  We do so many interesting things in our lives, but don't often take the time to recall them, 
        or to keep the details fresh in our minds to make the next time we do something even better.  Imagine you have a new hobby, and want to record what you learn 
        each time you do it, so that the next time you'll enjoy it even more.  Activity Tracker gives you a clear, visually stunning way to track your progress as 
        you get better at something you've loved doing for a long time or are now just beginning to love.  Enjoy keeping tabs on your favorite events with activity 
        tracker now!  Just enter as many categories of activities and hobbies you are interested in recording in the Activity Types link above, and then 
        use the home page to track your progress and experiences of events of that type.  We know you'll have a great time journaling your adventures!
